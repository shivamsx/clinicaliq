> **data/seed.py and data/ingest.py** — not included yet. They set up the SQLite database and ChromaDB vector store, which are introduced in later sessions.

## Session Folders

Session starter code is released one session at a time. Today's folder:

- `s01/` — Session 1: Basic conversational agent

To run after completing the TODOs:

```bash
cd s01/
python -m clinicaliq.agent
```

Each session folder has a `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPTS.md` with ready-to-use prompts for Claude Code.
